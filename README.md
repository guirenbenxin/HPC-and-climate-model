# HPC-and-climate-model
This repository contains the original serial Fortran code of the shallow cumulus convection physical process as well as heterogeneous codes calculated with different precisions.
The /src/physics/ directory is the physical process under the climate model cam, including UWshcu and other physical processes, during testing The UWshcu mode part can be replaced (UWshcu.F90 and convect_shallow.F90).
Code compilation and running examples are in the /script/ directory.
